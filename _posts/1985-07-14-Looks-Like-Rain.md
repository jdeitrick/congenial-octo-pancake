On July 14th, 1985, the Live Aid benefit concert took place simultaneously in London's Wembley Stadium and 
Philadelphia's John F. Kennedy Stadium. The event was organized by musician Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to 
raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. It featured performances by some of the biggest music acts of 
the time, including Queen, U2, David Bowie, Madonna, and many others. Live Aid became one of the largest 
and most iconic charity events in history, raising millions of dollars for humanitarian aid.
